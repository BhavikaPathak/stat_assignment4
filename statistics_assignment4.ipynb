    "## Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. The PMF is defined for each possible value of the random variable.\n",
    "## Example of PMF:\n",
    "Let's consider a fair six-sided die. The possible values of the random variable X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, each with equal probability since the die is fair. The PMF of this random variable is as follows:\n",
    "P(X = 1) = P(X = 2) = P(X = 3) = P(X = 4) = P(X = 5) = P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "## Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give the probability of the random variable taking on a specific value, as the probability of any single point in a continuous distribution is infinitesimally small. Instead, it provides the relative likelihood of the random variable falling within a range of values.\n",
    "## Example of PDF:\n",
    "Consider a continuous random variable X that follows a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). The PDF of the standard normal distribution is given by:\n",
    "f(x) = (1 / √(2π)) * exp(-x^2 / 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF provides the relative likelihood of the random variable falling within a range of values. For example, to find the probability that X lies between -1 and 1, you would integrate the PDF within that range:\n",
    "\n",
    "∫ from -1 to 1 (1 / √(2π)) * exp(-x^2 / 2) dx ≈ 0.6826\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that there is approximately a 68.26% chance that the value of X falls between -1 and 1 in a standard normal distribution."

    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function used to describe the cumulative probability distribution of a random variable. It gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. The CDF is defined for both discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "## Example of CDF:\n",
    "Let's consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of a single roll of the die. The possible values of X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since the die is fair, the probability of each outcome is 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF of this discrete random variable is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "F(x) = P(X ≤ x)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to calculate the probability of rolling a value less than or equal to 3 (i.e., x = 3):\n",
    "\n",
    "F(3) = P(X ≤ 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF value at x = 3 is 1/2, indicating that there is a 50% chance of rolling a value less than or equal to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The CDF is a crucial concept in probability and statistics for several reasons:\n",
    "1. Probabilities of Events: The CDF provides a convenient way to calculate the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a specific value.\n",
    "2. Visualizing Distributions: Plotting the CDF allows for a visual representation of the entire distribution of the random variable, showing how probabilities change as the value of the random variable increases.\n",
    "3. Assessing Percentiles: The CDF allows us to determine percentiles and quantiles of a distribution, helping to understand the spread and location of data points.\n",
    "4. Comparison of Distributions: The CDF enables the comparison of different distributions and their characteristics, such as location, spread, and shape.\n",
    "5. Interpolation and Extrapolation: The CDF can be used to interpolate or extrapolate probabilities between known values of a random variable."

    "The normal distribution is widely used in various fields to model continuous random variables with symmetric and bell-shaped distributions. Some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model include:\n",
    "1. Heights and Weights: Human heights and weights often follow approximately normal distributions.\n",

    "The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). These parameters determine the location and spread of the distribution, respectively.\n",

    "Mean (μ): The mean represents the center of the distribution. It determines the position of the peak or highest point on the distribution curve. Shifting the mean to the right or left moves the entire distribution along the x-axis without changing its shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation controls the spread or width of the distribution. A larger standard deviation results in a wider distribution, while a smaller standard deviation leads to a narrower distribution."

    "The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample means (or sums) of a large enough number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. As the sample size increases, the sample mean distribution becomes more and more normally distributed.\n",

    "1. Normality Approximation: The CLT allows us to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean (or sum) as a normal distribution, even if the original population distribution is not normal. This is especially useful because the normal distribution has well-known properties and is easier to work with mathematically.\n",
    "2. Sampling Distribution: The CLT provides valuable insights into the distribution of sample means. It tells us that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean becomes more and more normally distributed, centered around the population mean. This knowledge is crucial in understanding the behavior of sample statistics and their relationship to the population parameters.\n",
    "3. Confidence Intervals: With the CLT, we can construct confidence intervals for population parameters (such as the population mean) based on the sample mean. The normality of the sampling distribution allows us to calculate the standard error and establish confidence intervals with known properties.\n",
    "4. Hypothesis Testing: The CLT forms the foundation of many hypothesis tests, particularly when dealing with large samples. It enables us to perform tests like the Z-test and t-test, which rely on the assumption of normality or the approximation of normality for the sampling distribution.\n",
